<p></p><h2>Collection of general information when visiting our website <a name="general-data-collection"></a> </h2>
<h3>Nature and purpose of processing:</h3>
<p>When you access our website, i.e. when you do not register or otherwise submit information, information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, your IP address and the like.</p>
<p>In particular, they are processed for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,</li>
<li>ensuring the smooth use of our website,</li>
<li>evaluating system security and stability, and</li>
<li>to optimise our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about you personally. Information of this kind is statistically evaluated anonymously by us, if necessary, in order to optimise our website and the technology behind it.</p>
<h3>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h3>
<p>The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>
<h3>Recipients:</h3>
<p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as order processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>
<p></p><h3>Storage period:</h3>
<p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. For data used to provide the website, this is generally the case when the respective session has ended.</p>
<p>In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after 14 days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are anonymised so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.</p>
<p></p><h3>Provision prescribed or required:</h3>
<p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services may not be available or may be restricted. For this reason, an objection is excluded.</p>
